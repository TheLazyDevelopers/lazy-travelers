The Lazy Traveler!
Summary of idea:
TravelExplore is a travel website that provides users with a personalized travel experience.The website will use DOM, JSON, and event listeners to display options for different destinations based on the userâ€™s preferences.
What problem or pain point does it solve?             Travel planning can be overwhelming, especially when there are so many destinations to choose from. TravelExplore solves this problem by providing users with a personalized travel experience that offers tailored recommendations based on their preferences.
Minimum Viable Product (MVP) definition:
The MVP for TravelExplore will include a homepage where users can enter their destination.
What is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?
To present on the demo day, we need to have a functional homepage that accepts user inputs and displays recommendations based on their preferences. We also need to have a basic database of destinations.
