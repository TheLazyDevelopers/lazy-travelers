# Software Requirements Document

## What is the vision of this product?

   * Lazy Travellers aims to help people choose a vacation or remote work destination via a quiz.  Based on input provided by the user in response to visual representations of places the team has traveled to.  The quiz results will be returned to the user and a suggestion is made about the destination that was provided for them.

## What pain point does this project solve?
   
   * Oddly enough making the decision on where to travel can be a daunting one.  Having so many options, doing the research, and finally landing on one place is a time consuming task.  Having an interactive quiz that shows you some cool things from different destinations helps relieve some of that time pressure while having some fun.

## Why should we care about your product?

	* Well just about everyone loves to travel and with Covid regulations calming down around the world the time is now to get out and about and adventure.  Our team loves to travel and we have put our heart and soul into this experience in an effort to share the fun and joy we obtain through travel.  Finally, seeing different parts of the world really helps a person see the possibilities and the truth of what it means to live a beautiful and free life.

## Scope In - What will our product do?

   * The website will welcome the user and request a name input via form 
   * The home page will display a text blurb about the quiz and show 3 clickable photos
   * After submitting the proper number of votes (minimum 3) the view results button would be clickable
